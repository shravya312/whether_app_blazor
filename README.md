## 🔐 Authentication

The application uses Supabase Auth for user management:

- **Sign Up**: Create a new account with email and password
- **Sign In**: Login with existing credentials
- **Protected Routes**: Advanced features require authentication (Dashboard, Analytics, Profile)
- **User Profile**: View and manage user information on the Profile page
- **Role-Based Access**: Different features available for registered vs non-registered users

## 📊 Database Schema

### MongoDB Collections

1. **WeatherData**: Stores weather information
   - City name, Country
   - Temperature, FeelsLike, Humidity, Pressure
   - Visibility, WindSpeed, WindDirection, Cloudiness
   - Description, MainCondition, Icon
   - Latitude, Longitude
   - Timestamp

2. **CitySearchStats**: Tracks search frequency
   - City name
   - Search count
   - Last searched timestamp

### Supabase Tables

**favorite_cities** (Required for favorite cities feature):
```sql
CREATE TABLE favorite_cities (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  city TEXT NOT NULL,
  country TEXT NOT NULL,
  added_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE(user_id, city, country)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_favorite_cities_user_id ON favorite_cities(user_id);
```

**Note**: You need to create this table in your Supabase project for the favorite cities feature to work.

## 🎨 Key Features Explained

### Dynamic Popular Cities
The application tracks how many times each city is searched and displays the top 5 most popular cities in a dropdown. This list updates automatically as users search for different cities.

### Case-Insensitive Search
City names are normalized to Title Case (e.g., "bangalore" → "Bangalore") to ensure consistent searching and storage.

### Weather Data Caching
Weather data is stored in MongoDB to reduce API calls and improve performance.

### Auto-Location Detection
Uses browser Geolocation API to automatically detect user's location and fetch weather data. Requires user permission.

### 5-Day Forecast
Provides detailed weather forecast for the next 5 days with 3-hour intervals, including temperature ranges, precipitation, and weather conditions.

### Favorite Cities
Registered users can save favorite cities for quick access. Data is stored in Supabase and synced across devices.

### Weather Alerts
Automatically detects and displays alerts for severe weather conditions including extreme temperatures, high winds, thunderstorms, and heavy precipitation.

### Weather Analytics
Provides comprehensive analytics including:
- Temperature trends over time
- Humidity and precipitation patterns
- City-to-city weather comparison
- Statistical analysis of weather data

### Progressive Web App
The application can be installed as a PWA, works offline with cached data, and supports background sync for weather updates.

### Theme System
- Dark/Light mode toggle with persistent storage
- Weather-based dynamic themes that change colors based on current conditions

## 🛠️ Development

### Build the Projects

dotnet test
```

## 📝 Configuration Files

- `WeatherApp.API/appsettings.json` - API configuration (MongoDB, Weather API)
- `WeatherApp.Client/wwwroot/appsettings.json` - Client configuration (API URL, Supabase)

**Note**: `appsettings.Development.json` files are excluded from Git for security.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use
If you see "address already in use" error:
- Stop the running process (Ctrl+C)
- Or change the port in `Properties/launchSettings.json`

### API Connection Refused
- Ensure the API is running before starting the client
- Check that `ApiBaseUrl` in client config matches API URL
- Verify CORS settings in `WeatherApp.API/Program.cs`

### MongoDB Connection Issues
- Verify connection string in `appsettings.json`
- Check network connectivity to MongoDB Atlas
- Ensure IP whitelist includes your IP address
